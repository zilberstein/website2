I am a PhD Student at Cornell University. My research focuses on developing programming languages and formal methods that help developers more effectively reason about the correctness of their code. I strive to ground my work in my six years of experience as a Software Engineer at Facebook in order to create solutions that can be applied in practice and that scale well to large systems. During my time at Facebook, I successfully applied these ideas to formally verify critical concurrent algorithms and eliminate bugs using dependently typed code. Through my research and industry collaborations, I hope to bring about a new generation of software development techniques that can better meet the scale of todayâ€™s increasingly complex systems.
